        <p>
            Hi, I’m <strong>Manjula</strong>, a passionate and motivated <strong>BCA student from Bangalore</strong>, 
            currently in my 3rd year. I enjoy solving problems through code and continuously improving my 
            skills in <strong>Python, Flask, and web development</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m also preparing for <strong>NIMCET</strong> to pursue MCA, which reflects my commitment to 
            deepening my knowledge in computer applications. Alongside academics, I focus on 
            <strong>personal growth, coding projects, and self-learning</strong> to strengthen my foundation in technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            My areas of interest include:
            <ul>
                <li>Web Development (Flask, HTML, CSS)</li>
                <li>Data Analysis (Python, Pandas, Excel)</li>
                <li>Software Development & Problem Solving</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m currently seeking an <strong>internship opportunity</strong> where I can contribute, 
            learn from real-world projects, and grow into a well-rounded software professional.
